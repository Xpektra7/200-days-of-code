# Lists, Tuples and Range
Lists, tuples, and range are all iterables used to store multiple elements. Iterables in the sense that they can be looped through while performing operations on each element or based on each element.

## List
List is different from tuples and ranges, in that it's mutable i.e. its content can be modified; elements can be removed, added, edited, etc. Lists are used to store related data that may change over time and are declared using square brackets '[]'.

## Tuples
Tuples, on the other hand, are like lists except that they're immutable, i.e. after being assigned, their contents cannot be modified. Tuples are used to store sensitive data that you need to be free from being modified intentionally or accidentally. Tuples are declared using parentheses '()'.

## Range
Ranges are like predefined blueprints for generating sequences of numbers based on specified arguments. Ranges are mostly used with loops to iterate over the sequence of numbers. Ranges are declared using 'range(start, stop, step)'.
