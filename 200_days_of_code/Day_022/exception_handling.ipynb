    "# Exception handling\n",
    "Exception handling is the process of managing errors in your program so it can run without crashing. Instead of the program stopping when an error occurs, you catch the error and give helpful feedback, retry operations, or take alternative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also handle exceptions in our everyday life. For example, I don't just decide not to wash clothes because I've run out of detergent, there's no water in the tap, or there's no space on the lines. Instead, what I do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there's no water in the tap: I fetch from the well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If I've run out of detergent: I borrow from my roommates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there's no space on the lines: I spread some on the balcony and some with hangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a very important step in programming, as it ensures that your program remains stable, user-friendly, and predictable, even when things go wrong. Just like in real life, where you adapt and keep going, exception handling in code lets you manage problems without shutting everything down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, itâ€™s what separates a fragile program from a resilient one."
