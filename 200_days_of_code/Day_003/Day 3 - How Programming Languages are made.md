# HOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE CREATED

Programming languages are sets of instructions that tell a computer what to do, allowing developers to create software for various purposes. Examples include Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and Rust.

They were created to simplify and abstract away the complexity of machine code, making it easier to instruct computers.

## Creating a programming language involves:

1. Defining syntax and semantics: The structure (rules) and meaning (behavior) of code, along with supported data types and the execution model.

2. Building a lexical analyzer: To break source code into tokens.

3. Creating a parser: To convert tokens into an internal data structure and validate syntax and semantics of the code.

4. Implementing an interpreter or compiler: To execute the code or translate it into machine code.


In summary, creating a programming language involves defining its structure, breaking down code into manageable pieces, validating it, and then enabling its execution.
