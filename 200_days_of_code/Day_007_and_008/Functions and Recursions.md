# Functions and Recursions

Functions are reusable code blocks representing a set of instructions to be passed to a computer to perform specific tasks. They optionally return an output which maybe or not dependent on an input or set of inputs.

Functions are important because:
 * They decrease repetition and improve the clarity of the code.
 * They allow easier refactoring and debugging of the code.
 * They help to break complex tasks into simpler forms, serving as a core principle of Functional Programming, used by libraries or frameworks such as React ðŸŒš


Recursions are functions that keep calling itself to solve a lesser version of the same problem. A recursive function calls itself until a certain condition is met(base case). The base case is important in recursion to prevent the function from infinitely looping.
