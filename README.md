# 200 Days of Code

Welcome to my **200 Days of Code** journey — a personal challenge to consistently learn, build, and improve my skills in programming and problem solving over the course of 200 days.

## 📁 Structure

Each day has its own folder in this repository:
```
200 days of code/
├── Day 1/
├── Day 2/
├── ...
├── Day N/
```
Inside each folder, you'll find Python scripts, problem solutions, and experiments tied to that day’s focus.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Matplotlib (used in some visualizations)
- Time module (for benchmarking)

## ✅ Sample Highlights
- **Prime Number Analysis:** Optimized primality testing with step and time tracking.
- **Cube Root Estimation:** Approximation using binary search and (soon) Newton-Raphson methods.
- **Performance Graphs:** Visual representation of how complexity increases with input size.

## 💡 Goal
- Build discipline through daily coding
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Document and reflect on progress
