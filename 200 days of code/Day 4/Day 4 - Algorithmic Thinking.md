# WHAT IS ALGORITHMIC THINKING ‚ùì

Algorithmic Thinking is an approach to solving problems that involves the process of defining complex tasks into finite sequential instructions. Algorithmic thinking is the backbone of computational programming as it helps to generate a clearly defined pathway that enable the computer carry out tasks more effectively and efficiently.

Below is an diagrammatic representation of the algorithmic thinking approach to washing clothes.
